Proc-PersistentControl
======================

This module creates background processes and allows to track
them from multiple invocations of a perl program, i. e. not only
from the parent.

The module is intended to a simple as possible. It should have as
few other modules as prerequisites as possible, only modules
that are likely to be installed in a "typical" perl installation (i. e.
core modules, or "standard" Win32 modules on Windows). It should be
usable on any Unix with the perl that comes with the OS.    

The intended use cases of this module are things like programs
that need to start and control "a few" background processes, but
do this consistently over multiple invocations of the program (like
when they are scheduled by cron).

This module has been tested on:

AIX 6.1 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.8.8)
AIX 7.1 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.10.1)
CentOS 6.5 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.10.1)
GNU/Linux armv5tel on a QNAP TS-212 NAS with Optware perl (5.10.0) (*)
Raspbian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy) with /usr/bin/perl (v5.14.2)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.10.1)
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.3 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.10.0)
Solaris (SunOS 5.10 sparc) with /usr/bin/perl (v5.8.4)
Ubuntu 10.04.4 i586 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.10.1)
Ubuntu 12.04.04 x86_64 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.14.2)

CYGWIN_NT-6.1 1.7.13/Windows 7 with /usr/bin/perl (v5.10.1)
